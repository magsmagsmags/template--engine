# User Story 
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

### User input

The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

### Roster output

The project must generate a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

  * Name
  * Role
  * ID
  * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)

# Technology
* HTML
* CSS
* Node.js
* NPM Inquirer
